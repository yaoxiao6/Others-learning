    "There are two ways to choose objects from a collection in probability: with replacement and without replacement:\n",

    "  - **With Replacement**:  After an object, such as a playing card, is selected from a collection (such as a deck of cards), it is put back into the collection before the next selection. This is the usual situation when choosing virtual objects such as letter and numbers. In general, the probabilities of various events do not change as objects are chosen, because by putting the object back, you are ensuring that each choice is independent.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Without Replacement**:  After the object is selected, it is NOT put back into the collection. This is the usual situation in card games, where the dealer chooses cards to distribute to the players, and they are given to the players, and not put back in the deck. In general, the probability of events will change, as the sample set is changed by the removal of one object. The choices are NOT independent. "

If more than one player remains after that first round of betting, there follows a first round of drawing. Each active player specifies how many cards he or she wishes to discard and replace with new cards from the deck. If you are happy with your holding and do not want to draw any cards, you “stand pat.”\n",

When you learn poker, then, one of the first things you have to learn is the ordering of the hands from most to least likely. <i>Poker probability</i> refers to calculating the exact probabilities of hands. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_probability\">Wikipedia article</a> contains the exact results and the formulae used to calculate them. \n",
